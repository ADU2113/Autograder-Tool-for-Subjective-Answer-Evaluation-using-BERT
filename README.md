# Autograder-Tool-for-Subjective-Answer-Evaluation-using-BERT
INTRODUCTION:
Subjective questions and answers let students show what they know in their own words, without strict rules or constraints.
However, subjective answers are different from objective ones in a few important ways. They tend to be longer, take more time to write, and require teachers to focus and stay objective while grading.
Evaluating a subjective answer means the grader has to carefully review every word, and their mental well-being, fatigue greatly affect the final score.
So, itâ€™s more efficient in terms of time and resources to have a system handle the tedious and quite crucial task of grading subjective answers.
The system proposes a new and improved way of evaluating descriptive question answers automatically using BERT Model and natural language processing.
